            Odoo is a multi-tenant system: a single Odoo system may run and serve a number of database instances. It is
            also highly customizable, with customizations (starting from the modules being loaded) depending on the
            “current database”.

            This is not an issue when working with the backend (web client) as a logged-in company user: the database
            can be selected when logging in, and customizations loaded afterwards.

            However it is an issue for non-logged users (portal, website) which aren’t bound to a database: Odoo needs
            to know which database should be used to load the website page or perform the operation. If multi-tenancy is
            not used that is not an issue, there’s only one database to use, but if there are multiple databases
            accessible Odoo needs a rule to know which one it should use.

            That is one of the purposes of --db-filter: it specifies how the database should be selected based on the
            hostname (domain) that is being requested. The value is a regular expression, possibly including the
            dynamically injected hostname (%h) or the first subdomain (%d) through which the system is being accessed.

            For servers hosting multiple databases in production, especially if website is used, dbfilter must be set,
            otherwise a number of features will not work correctly.
